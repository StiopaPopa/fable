Fable began with a simple question: What if a story could adapt to your state of mind? As our team explored EEG technology, we became excited about the idea of measuring brain waves and uncovering hidden patterns of thought. What if a narrative could respond to your level of focus and relaxationâ€”your shifting mental state? With EEG headsets reading brain activity, Fable dynamically shapes its plot, characters, sound effects, and visuals, crafting a living, breathing story that unfolds uniquely for you. This isnâ€™t just storytellingâ€”itâ€™s an experience powered by your mind.
